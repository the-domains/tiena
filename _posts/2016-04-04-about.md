ABOUT TIENA

Tiena Gwin started Tiena in Spring of 2015\.  Being a designer was a childhood dream of Tiena's.  The dream was ignited when seeing a runway show during the last few minutes of Headline News on CNN.  Overtime, she did not feel like that dream was doable being from Memphis, TN.  Although, continuing to keep a sketch book and sketch designs.  After many life experiences, Tiena began to revisit those childhood dreams and respond to the voice in her head that wouldn't go away and began the journey of realizing her dream by enrolling in the Arkansas School of Fashion in 2011\.
